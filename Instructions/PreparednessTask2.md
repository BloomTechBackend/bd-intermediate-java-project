Preparedness Task 2: Hello, Project Buddy
===========================================

Create a document in the src/resources directory named `preparedness-task2.txt`. Inside this document, tell people a little about yourself. You are free to share as much or as little as you wish

*   What is your previous technical background?
*   How did you prepare for Lambda School?
*   Give us 3 fun facts about you.

Now see if the Preparedness Task 2 tests all pass.

Each test should be run separately using the following commands - one command per test:

    `./gradlew -q clean :test`

If you wish to run all the Task Completion Tests, the command is:

    `./gradlew -q clean TCT`

Go ahead and push the change. After your code is pushed, watch for the Preparedness Task 2 on CodeGrade to be passing.
